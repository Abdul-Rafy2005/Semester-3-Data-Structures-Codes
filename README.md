Semester 3 - Data Structures Codes 🧑‍💻
Hey there! 👋

This repo is all about my journey through Data Structures in Semester 3. I’ve solved some interesting problems to really get the hang of how these structures work and why they’re so important. You’ll find stuff like:

Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular—you name it!)
Binary Trees 🌳 (and the chaos they bring 😂)
Stacks and Queues (basically the push-and-pop squad 🚀)
Hashing and Searching Techniques 🔍
I made this repo to keep track of my progress, share what I’ve learned, and maybe even help someone else along the way. Feel free to check it out, and let me know what you think! 😊
